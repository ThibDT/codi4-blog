Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche,  it took us a week to climb out. Now,  I don't know exactly when we turned on each other,  but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an oath,  that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow that killed the other two,  but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.",  author: 1  },

In a comic, you know how you can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact opposite of the hero. And most times they're friends, like you and me! I should've known way back when... You know why, David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass.", author: 1 },

But I can't give you this case, it don't belong to me. Besides, I've already been through too much shit this morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb ass.", author: 1 },

Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's what you see at a toy store. And you must think you're in a toy store, because you're here shopping for an infant named Jeb.", author: 3 },

Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.", author: 2 }
